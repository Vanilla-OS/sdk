# Vanilla OS SDK Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Vanilla OS SDK! This guide aims to provide
developers with guidelines and best practices for developing with the SDK.

## Purpose

The Vanilla OS SDK is a collection of libraries and tools that allow developers
to create applications for the Vanilla OS platform. The SDK provides a set of
APIs that allow developers to access the platform's features, such as the
notification system, the user interface, and the file system.

The SDK is also used internally by the Vanilla OS team to develop the platform
itself.

## Getting Started
