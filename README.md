# Vanilla OS SDK

The Vanilla OS SDK is a collection of libraries and tools that allow developers
to create applications for the Vanilla OS platform in a standardized and
consistent manner.

## Status

The SDK is currently in **early development**, its features are not yet stable
and are subject to change. Also note that this SDK targets Vanilla OS Vision,
not Orchid (Vanilla OS 2), so do not expect it to work in Orchid or any other
operating system.
